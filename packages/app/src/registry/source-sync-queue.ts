/**
 * Creates a bounded-concurrency queue that syncs sources via the provided
 * `syncSource` callback.
 *
 * - `enqueue(sourceId)` — registers a source; dispatches up to `concurrency`
 *   syncs immediately.
 * - `onFirstSettled()` — resolves once the first sync has settled (success or
 *   failure). Resolves immediately if a sync has already settled at call time,
 *   preventing a race where the sync finishes before the caller awaits.
 * - `onIdle()` — resolves once all enqueued sources are done and the queue is
 *   empty. Also resolves immediately when the queue is already idle.
 * @param syncSource
 * @param concurrency
