**AI Primitives Hub** transforms how you discover and manage GitHub Copilot prompts. Browse a visual marketplace, search by tags, and install curated prompt libraries with a single click—no manual file copying or repository cloning required.

> **ℹ️ Note:** This project was formerly known as **Prompt Registry**. It has been renamed to **AI Primitives Hub** to better reflect its broader scope. The extension ID (`AmadeusITGroup.prompt-registry`) and package name remain unchanged for compatibility — seeing `prompt-registry` in install commands and file names is expected.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install** — Search "AI Primitives Hub" in VS Code Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. **Select Hub** — On first launch, choose a hub from the welcome dialog (or skip to configure later)
3. **Browse** — Click "MARKETPLACE" in the AI Primitives Hub sidebar
4. **Install** — Click any bundle tile, then click **Install**
5. **Use** — Open Copilot Chat and type `/` to see your installed prompts, or run the **"AI Primitives Hub: Sync All Bundles"** command to verify everything synced 🎉

The extension automatically adds the Awesome Copilot source and syncs your selected hub's profiles on startup.

## 📖 Core Concepts

New to the project? These six terms appear everywhere:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Primitive** | A single AI asset: a prompt, instruction, agent, chat mode, skill, or MCP server configuration |
| **Bundle** | An installable package of primitives, described by a `deployment-manifest.yml` |
| **Collection** | A repository that offers one or more bundles |
| **Source** | Anywhere bundles come from — a GitHub repo, a local directory, an APM repository, or Awesome Copilot |
| **Hub** | A shared configuration that defines profiles for a team or organization |
| **Profile** | A named set of bundles within a hub (e.g. "frontend team") |

Every bundle ships a manifest that declares its contents. A minimal example:

```yaml
# deployment-manifest.yml
name: my-team-prompts
version: 1.0.0
description: Shared prompts for the frontend team
primitives:
  - type: prompt
    path: prompts/write-unit-tests.prompt.md
  - type: instruction
    path: instructions/typescript-style.instructions.md
```

Manifests are validated against the JSON schemas in [`schemas/`](./schemas/) at install time.

→ [Author Guide: Creating a Collection](./docs/author-guide/creating-source-bundle.md)

### Host editor support

The extension runs in VS Code and its forks. For **workspace (repository) scope** installs, it detects the host editor automatically and routes primitives to the folder that editor actually reads — no configuration needed:

| Host editor | Workspace destination |
|-------------|----------------------|
| VS Code / VS Code Insiders | `.github/` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/` |

Only editors that are VS Code forks (and therefore actually run this extension) are detected. An unrecognized host falls back to the VS Code `.github/` layout, so behavior is never worse than before. Non-VS-Code tools such as Claude Code and Devin are CLI/cloud agents that do not run this extension, so they are not host-detected (the CLI can still target them explicitly).

> **Note:** Detection applies to new installs only. If you previously installed bundles into `.github/` while running Kiro, those files are **not** migrated automatically — reinstall the bundle (or move the files) to place them under `.kiro/`.

## 🤖 Ask Copilot About AI Primitives Hub

AI Primitives Hub ships with a built-in **Copilot skill** that lets you ask GitHub Copilot questions about the extension directly in chat. No extra setup is required — the skill is available as soon as the extension is installed.

**What you can ask:**
- **Users** — "How do I add a local source?", "What scopes are available?", "Why isn't my hub showing?"
- **Authors** — "How do I create a collection?", "What fields are required in a manifest?", "How do I publish to a hub?"

The skill answers from the extension's own documentation, so responses are always grounded in the actual behavior of your installed version.

> **Note:** The skill covers user and author topics only. For contributor questions (architecture, testing, internals), consult the [Contributor Guide](./docs/contributor-guide/development-setup.md) directly.

> **Seeing incorrect or unexpected answers?** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/ai-primitives-hub/issues) describing the question you asked and the response you received, or reach out to one of the project contributors directly.

## 📦 Installation


**From VS Code Marketplace:**
1. Open VS Code → Press `Ctrl+Shift+X`
2. Search "AI Primitives Hub" → Click **Install**

**From VSIX:**

Download the latest `.vsix` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/ai-primitives-hub/releases), then install it (replace `<version>` with the version you downloaded):

```bash
code --install-extension prompt-registry-<version>.vsix
```

**From Source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/ai-primitives-hub.git
cd ai-primitives-hub
npm install
npm run package:vsix
# Install the VSIX produced by the previous step (the filename includes the current version)
code --install-extension prompt-registry-<version>.vsix
```

**For custom VS Code instances** (with custom user-data-dir/extensions-dir):
```bash
# After building the VSIX above, install to your custom VS Code instance
code --user-data-dir "$ud" --extensions-dir "$ed" --install-extension prompt-registry-<version>.vsix
```

## 🔌 Supported Sources

| Source Type | Description
|-------------|-------------|
| **Awesome Copilot** | Curated community collections
| **GitHub** | Direct from GitHub repositories
| **Local** | File system directories 
| **APM** | APM package repositories

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The extension is layered: UI → Commands → Services → Adapters → Storage, with the **RegistryManager** orchestrating everything. All source types are accessed through a common **adapter** interface, so the rest of the codebase never contains source-specific logic.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UI[Marketplace webview and tree views] --> CMD[Commands]
    CMD --> RM[RegistryManager<br/>central orchestrator]
    RM --> AD[Adapters<br/>GitHub / Local / APM / Awesome Copilot]
    AD --> BI[BundleInstaller<br/>validate, extract, record]
    BI --> MCP[MCP server integration]
    BI --> SYNC[User scope sync<br/>copies primitives into Copilot folders]
    RM --> ST[(Persistent registry state)]
```

**Install flow:** the adapter fetches the bundle → its `deployment-manifest.yml` is validated against the [JSON schemas](./schemas/) → contents are extracted to managed storage → primitives are synced into the folders GitHub Copilot reads → the update service tracks the bundle for new versions.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Bundles not showing in Copilot?**
- Check sync completed in extension logs
- Run "AI Primitives Hub: Sync All Bundles"
- Reload VS Code (Command Palette → **"Developer: Reload Window"**)
- Verify the synced files exist on disk:


| OS | Synced prompts location |
|----|------------------------|
| Linux | `~/.config/Code/User/prompts` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts` |

**Installation fails?**
- Verify network connection and repository access
- Check bundle has valid `deployment-manifest.yml` (validated against [`schemas/`](./schemas/))
