# 🎨 AI Primitives Hub

> A monorepo for the AI Primitives Hub: a VS Code marketplace and a shared set of ports-and-adapters packages for discovering, installing, and managing GitHub Copilot prompt libraries.

**AI Primitives Hub** lets users discover and manage GitHub Copilot prompts through a VS Code extension, while providing reusable domain libraries, adapters, and a CLI for building, installing, and transforming prompt collections across multiple targets.

> **ℹ️ Note:** This project was formerly known as **Prompt Registry**. The VS Code extension ID (`AmadeusITGroup.prompt-registry`) and lockfile names remain unchanged for compatibility — seeing `prompt-registry` in paths is expected.

| `packages/core/` | Domain types and port interfaces |
| `packages/infra/` | Adapter implementations: sources, stores, writers, scaffolding |
| `packages/app/` | Use-case orchestration: install, registry, discovery, transforms |
| `packages/cli/` | Terminal interface calling `app` |
| `lib/` | Legacy collection scripts (deprecated in place) |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The monorepo is organized around a shared `core` domain, with `infra` adapters, an `app` orchestration layer, and thin delivery layers for the VS Code extension and the CLI.
