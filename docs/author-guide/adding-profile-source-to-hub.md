# Adding Profiles and Sources to Existing Hubs

Extend existing hubs by adding new sources or profiles to the hub configuration file.

If you do not have a Hub yet, start with [Creating a Hub](./creating-a-hub.md).

## Prerequisites

- Write access to the hub's configuration repository
- Understanding of [Hub Schema](../reference/hub-schema.md)
- Source repositories must be accessible to hub users (e.g., hosted in a public GitHub organization or one visible to your target audience)

## Adding a Source

### 1. Edit Hub Configuration

Open the hub's YAML configuration file and add a new source to the `sources` array:

```yaml
sources:
  # Existing sources...
  
  - id: "my-new-source"                    # Unique identifier
    type: "github"                         # Source type
    repository: "myorg/new-prompt-bundles" # Repository location
    name: "My New Source"                  # Display name
    enabled: true                          # Enable immediately
    priority: 75                           # Priority (0-100, higher = more priority)
    config:
      branch: "main"                       # Git branch
    metadata:
      description: "Additional prompt bundles for specialized workflows"
      homepage: "https://github.com/myorg/new-prompt-bundles"
```

### 2. Source Types

Choose a source type accepted by the current Hub schema. For a versioned
collection published through GitHub releases, use `github`.

| Type | Use Case | Required Fields |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `github` | GitHub repository | `repository` |
| `local` | Local filesystem source | `url` |
| `awesome-copilot` | YAML collections | `repository` |
| `local-awesome-copilot` | Local YAML collections | `url` |
| `apm` | APM packages | `url` |
| `local-apm` | Local APM packages | `url` |
| `skills` | GitHub repository containing skills | `repository` |

Source types supported elsewhere in the product are not necessarily valid in
a Hub. Check the [Hub Schema](../reference/hub-schema.md) before adding one.

For a `local` source inside `hub-config.yml`, `url` is the filesystem path to
that collection source. By contrast, the CLI's `hub add --location` flag in
the validation steps below points to the Hub's `hub-config.yml` file itself.
`location` is a CLI option, not a source field in the YAML.

### 3. Priority Guidelines

The Hub schema accepts priorities from `0` through `100`; higher values win
when sources conflict. There are no canonical category ranges. Choose values
relative to the other sources in the same Hub and document any team-specific
convention in the Hub repository.

## Adding a Profile

Profiles group bundles from multiple sources into themed collections.

### 1. Add Profile Entry

Add a new profile to the `profiles` array:

```yaml
profiles:
  # Existing profiles...
  
  - id: "data-science"                     # Unique identifier
    name: "Data Science Toolkit"          # Display name
    description: "Prompts for data analysis, ML, and visualization"
    icon: "📊"                             # Optional emoji icon
    bundles:
      - id: "python-data"                  # Bundle from any source
        version: "latest"                  # Version or "latest"
        source: "my-new-source"            # Source ID
        required: true                     # Mandatory bundle
      - id: "jupyter-helpers"
        version: "2.1.0"
        source: "official-bundles"
        required: false                    # Optional bundle
    path:                                  # Optional: organize in UI
      - "development"
      - "specialized"
```

### 2. Bundle Requirements

Each bundle in a profile needs:
- **id**: Must match a bundle ID from one of the hub's sources
- **version**: Semantic version or `"latest"`
- **source**: Must reference a source ID defined in the hub
- **required**: `true` for mandatory bundles, `false` for optional

Pin a semantic version for stable or production profiles whose contents
should change only through a reviewed Hub update. Use `latest` only when
following the newest available collection is intentional, such as during
development.

### 3. Profile Organization

Use the `path` array to organize profiles in the UI:

```yaml
path:
  - "engineering"      # Top level
  - "backend"          # Sub-category
```

This creates a hierarchy: Engineering → Backend → [Profile Name]

## Testing Changes

### 1. Validate Configuration

Before committing, validate your hub configuration:

```bash
ai-primitives-hub hub add \
  --type local \
  --location ./hub-config.yml \
  --id hub-validation \
  --no-use \
  --no-sync
```

This runs the CLI's shared runtime checks. For full JSON Schema validation,
run **AI Primitives Hub: Import Hub** from the VS Code Command Palette and
select the local `hub-config.yml` file.

### 2. Test Source Connectivity

Ensure new sources are accessible:
- GitHub repos are public or you have access
- HTTP URLs return valid bundle data
- Local paths exist and contain valid bundles

### 3. Verify Bundle References

Check that profile bundles exist in their specified sources:
- Bundle IDs match exactly
- Versions are available
- Sources contain the referenced bundles

## Publishing Changes

### 1. Commit and Push

```bash
git add hub-config.yml
git commit -m "Add data science profile and new source"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Hub Metadata

Update the hub's metadata section:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Engineering Team Hub"
  description: "Centralized prompt management for the engineering organization"
  maintainer: "Platform Team"
  updatedAt: "2026-08-16T00:00:00Z"  # Replace with the current ISO 8601 timestamp
```

### 3. Notify Users

Users can sync the updated hub:
- Right-click hub in Registry Explorer → "Sync Hub"
- Or open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or
  `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and run **AI Primitives Hub: Sync Hub**.

Hub sync refreshes the configuration and source catalog. For a profile that is
already active, it can reveal added, removed, or version-changed bundle
references, but it does not automatically install, remove, or update those
collections. **Sync Profile** accepts the updated profile definition, but it
also does not install bundles. Bundle installation, updates, and removal remain
separate user actions.

## Example: Complete Addition

Here's a complete example adding both a source and profile:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"

metadata:
  name: "Engineering Team Hub"
  description: "Centralized prompt management for the engineering organization"
  maintainer: "Platform Team"
  updatedAt: "2026-08-16T00:00:00Z"  # Replace with the current ISO 8601 timestamp

sources:
  # Existing sources...
  - id: "official-bundles"
    type: "github"
    repository: "myorg/prompt-bundles"
    enabled: true
    priority: 100

  # New source
  - id: "ml-prompts"
    type: "github"
    repository: "myorg/ml-prompt-collection"
    name: "ML Prompt Collection"
    enabled: true
    priority: 80
    config:
      branch: "main"
    metadata:
      description: "Machine learning and data science prompts"

profiles:
  # Existing profiles...
  
  # New profile
  - id: "ml-engineer"
    name: "ML Engineer Toolkit"
    description: "Essential prompts for machine learning engineers"
    icon: "🤖"
    bundles:
      - id: "model-training"
        version: "latest"
        source: "ml-prompts"
        required: true
      - id: "data-preprocessing"
        version: "1.5.0"
        source: "ml-prompts"
        required: true
      - id: "general-python"
        version: "latest"
        source: "official-bundles"
        required: false
    path:
      - "engineering"
      - "ml"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Source Not Loading
- Verify repository exists and is accessible
- Check branch name in config
- Ensure repository contains valid bundles

### Profile Bundles Missing
- Confirm bundle IDs exist in specified sources
- Check version availability
- Verify source is enabled and synced

### Permission Issues
- Ensure you have write access to the hub repository
- Check if the hub requires specific permissions for contributors
